      Thophles Williams is a Chicago-based designer and developer currently studying at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
      Though he originally intended to work as a graphic designer, he saw more value in producing designs that
      were focused on the people and intuitive experiences rather than only being pixel-perfect designs. He also dove into
      the world of programming after realizing it allowed him to produce more logical designs and destroy
      language barriers between him and his teammates. After doing well at a summer internship, he worked as a UI designer
      for a property-management software company called Spare to Share and heavily contributed to the companyâ€™s
      complete re-design of their interface and brand. He currently works remotely as a lead UI designer for a
      new tech-startup called Highkey.
